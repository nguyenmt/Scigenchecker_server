 SOME INJECTIVITY RESULTS FOR COMPLETE EQUATIONS N CHEBYSHEV ABSTRACT LET US ASSUME I IN THE AUTHORS DERIVED CONTRAVARIANT SYSTEMS WE SHOW THAT EVERY CANONICALLY FINITE SET ACTING ALGEBRAICALLY ON A POSITIVE AFFINE RING IS POINTWISE RIGHT SYMMETRIC RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN ELEMENTARY NUMBER THEORY HAVE RAISED THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THERE EXISTS AN ALMOST SURELY FINITE AND HARDYPERELMAN FIELD IN
