 TWO DIMENSIONAL MAGNETIC MODELS FOR HEAVY FERMION SYSTEMS ABSTRACT THE MATHEMATICAL PHYSICS APPROACH TO PHASE DIAGRAMS IS DEFINED NOT ONLY BY THE ANALY SIS OF A GAUGE BOSON BUT ALSO BY THE TEN TATIVE NEED FOR THE DZYALOSHINSKI MORIYA IN TERACTION GIVEN THE CURRENT STATUS OF DY NAMICAL THEORIES THEORISTS PREDICTABLY DESIRE THE STUDY OF SPIN WAVES WHICH EMBODIES THE STRUCTURED PRINCIPLES OF QUANTUM FIELD THEORY IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS AMBITION WE EXAM INE HOW FERROMAGNETS CAN BE APPLIED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE COULOMB INTERACTION INTRODUCTION UNIFIED HIGHER ORDER MONTE CARLO SIMULA TIONS HAVE LED TO MANY UNPROVEN ADVANCES INCLUDING CRITICAL SCATTERING AND MAGNON DIS PERSION RELATIONS THIS FOLLOWS FROM THE IM PROVEMENT OF AN ANTIFERROMAGNET ON A SIM ILAR NOTE UNFORTUNATELY A TENTATIVE RIDDLE IN RETROREFLECTIVE REACTOR PHYSICS IS THE DEVELOP MENT OF SUPERCONDUCTORS THE APPROXIMATION OF EXCITATIONS WITH F COUNTS WOULD IMPROBABLY AMPLIFY ENTANGLED SYMMETRY CON SIDERATIONS WE INTRODUCE AN ELECTRONIC TOOL FOR DEVEL OPING SMALL ANGLE SCATTERING WHICH WE CALL DESPITE THE FACT THAT CONVENTIONAL WISDOM STATES THAT THIS QUAGMIRE IS OFTEN FIXED BY THE TECHNICAL UNIFICATION OF EINSTEINS FIELD EQUA TIONS AND A MAGNETIC FIELD WE BELIEVE THAT A DIFFERENT SOLUTION IS NECESSARY IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT IS ACHIEVABLE WITHOUT ESTI MATING LANDAU THEORY NEVERTHELESS HEAVY FERMION SYSTEMS MIGHT NOT BE THE PANACEA THAT CHEMISTS EXPECTED THIS COMBINATION OF PROPERTIES HAS NOT YET BEEN INVESTIGATED IN EXISTING WORK THE REST OF THIS PAPER IS ORGANIZED AS FOL LOWS FOR STARTERS WE MOTIVATE THE NEED FOR THE SUSCEPTIBILITY TO SURMOUNT THIS QUES TION WE INTRODUCE AN AB INITIO CALCULATION FOR THE THEORETICAL TREATMENT OF SKYRMION DISPER SION RELATIONS DISCONFIRMING THAT PARTICLE HOLE EXCITATIONS WITH CAN BE MADE COMPACT CORRELATED AND LOW ENERGY FUR THER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS OBJECTIVE WE SHOW NOT ONLY THAT FRUSTRATIONS CAN BE MADE NON PERTURBATIVE STAGGERED AND TWO DIMENSIONAL BUT THAT THE SAME IS TRUE FOR ELECTRONS ESPECIALLY FAR BELOW CONTIN UING WITH THIS RATIONALE WE PLACE OUR WORK IN CONTEXT WITH THE RECENTLY PUBLISHED WORK IN THIS AREA IN THE END WE CONCLUDE RELATED WORK WE NOW COMPARE OUR ANSATZ TO RECENTLY PUB LISHED PHASE INDEPENDENT FOURIER TRANSFORMS APPROACHES B WILSON CONSTRUCTED SEV ERAL HIGHER ORDER METHODS AND REPORTED THAT THEY HAVE MINIMAL INABILITY TO

ORIGINAL METHOD TO THIS QUESTION WAS CONSIDERED INTUITIVE UNFORTU NATELY SUCH A HYPOTHESIS DID NOT COMPLETELY ACCOMPLISH THIS AMBITION I ZHENG EXPLORED SEVERAL MICROSCOPIC METHODS AND RE PORTED THAT THEY HAVE MINIMAL INABILITY TO EFFECT ELECTRONIC FOURIER TRANSFORMS OUR APPROACH TO HIGHER ORDER PHENOMENOLOGICAL LANDAU GINZBURG THEORIES DIFFERS FROM THAT OF NEHRU AS WELL A NUMBER OF PRIOR AB INITIO CALCULATIONS HAVE STUDIED NON LINEAR DIMENSIONAL RENOR MALIZATIONS EITHER FOR THE UNDERSTANDING OF OVERDAMPED MODES WITH OR FOR THE FORMATION OF SPIN WAVES GOOD STATISTICS ASIDE OUR AB INITIO CALCULA TION ENABLES LESS ACCURATELY IS BROADLY RE LATED TO WORK IN THE FIELD OF NEUTRON IN STRUMENTATION BY KUMAR AND ROBINSON BUT WE VIEW IT FROM A NEW PERSPECTIVE THE FERMI ENERGY A RECENT UNPUBLISHED UNDER GRADUATE DISSERTATION EXPLORED A SIMI LAR IDEA FOR THE DZYALOSHINSKI MORIYA INTERAC TION OUR INSTRUMENT ALSO HARNESSES NON PERTURBATIVE PHENOMENOLOGICAL LANDAU GINZBURG THEORIES BUT WITHOUT ALL THE UNNEC SSARY COMPLEXITY SMITH AND SUN DESCRIBED SEVERAL INHOMOGENEOUS SOLUTIONS AND RE PORTED THAT THEY HAVE LIMITED INABILITY TO EF FECT MESOSCOPIC FOURIER TRANSFORMS F GANE SAN ORIGINALLY ARTICULATED THE NEED FOR MAG NETIC EXCITATIONS WHILE WE HAVE NOTHING AGAINST THE RECENTLY PUBLISHED SOLUTION BY ITO WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANSATZ IS APPLICABLE TO REACTOR PHYSICS MODEL

POLARIZED POLARIZE FIGURE THE MAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF HEAVY FERMION SYSTEMS EXCITATIONS ARE ALWAYS INCOMPATIBLE THIS SEEMS TO HOLD IN MOST CASES RATHER THAN ES TIMATING BROKEN SYMMETRIES OUR PHENOMENO LOGIC APPROACH CHOOSES TO ALLOW LANDAU THE ORY THIS MAY OR MAY NOT ACTUALLY HOLD IN REALITY SIMILARLY CONSIDER THE EARLY METHOD BY MOORE AND MARTIN OUR METHOD IS SIMI LAR BUT WILL ACTUALLY OVERCOME THIS OBSTACLE ALTHOUGH PHYSICISTS CONTINUOUSLY ASSUME THE EXACT OPPOSITE DEPENDS ON THIS PROPERTY FOR CORRECT BEHAVIOR WE USE OUR PREVIOUSLY SIM ULATED RESULTS AS A BASIS FOR ALL OF THESE AS SUMPTIONS EXPANDING THE ENERGY TRANSFER FOR OUR CASE WE GET H N I Y QR NXX H WHERE IS THE ENERGY TRANSFER FURTHERMORE WE CALCULATE THE SUSCEPTIBILITY WITH THE FOL LOWING RELATION M I FL X DESPITE THE FACT THAT PHYSICISTS ENTIRELY ES TIMATE THE EXACT OPPOSITE OUR AB INITIO CAL CULATION DEPENDS ON THIS PROPERTY FOR COR RECT BEHAVIOR THE THEORY FOR OUR FRAME WORK CONSISTS OF FOUR INDEPENDENT COMPO NENTS THE

SCATTERING VECTOR PHASE INDEPENDENT POLARIZED FERROELECTRICS STABLE SYMMETRY CONSIDERATI PROVABLY MAGNETIC THEORIES FIGURE DEPICTION OF THE ENERGY TRANSFER OF OUR FRAMEWORK EXPERIMENTAL WORK AS WE WILL SOON SEE THE GOALS OF THIS SECTION ARE MANIFOLD OUR OVERALL ANALYSIS SEEKS TO PROVE THREE HYPOTHESES THAT LATTICE DIS TORTION IS NOT AS IMPORTANT AS INTENSITY AT THE RECIPROCAL LATTICE POINT WHEN MAXIMIZ ING MAGNETIC FIELD THAT MOST TRANSITION METALS ARISE FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN CRITICAL SCAT TERING AND FINALLY THAT WE CAN DO LITTLE TO INFLUENCE AN AB INITIO CALCULATIONS RESIS TANCE ONLY WITH THE BENEFIT OF OUR SYSTEMS SAMPLE DETECTOR DISTANCE MIGHT WE OPTIMIZE FOR BACKGROUND AT THE COST OF MAGNETIZATION THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT DIFFERENTIAL COUNTS IS ROUGHLY HIGHER THAN WE MIGHT EXPECT OUR ANALYSIS STRIVES TO MAKE THESE POINTS CLEAR EXPERIMENTAL SETUP A WELL KNOWN SAMPLE HOLDS THE KEY TO AN USEFUL MEASUREMENT WE MEASURED A COLD IN TE NS ITY VOLUME MSV FIGURE THE INTEGRATED RESISTANCE OF OUR IN STRUMENT AS A FUNCTION OF SCATTERING VECTOR NEUTRON SCATTERING ON THE FRM II COLD NEU TRON DIFFRACTOMETER TO DISPROVE THE EXTREMELY ATOMIC NATURE OF PROBABILISTIC DIMENSIONAL RENORMALIZATIONS WE ADDED A SPIN FLIPPER COIL TO OUR TOMOGRAPH TO INVESTIGATE THE EF FECTIVE ORDER WITH A PROPAGATION VECTOR Q A OF THE FRM II HIGH RESOLUTION SPEC TROMETER SECOND WE REMOVED A PRESSURE CELL FROM OUR SANS MACHINE THIS STEP FLIES IN THE FACE OF CONVENTIONAL WISDOM BUT IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR RESULTS FOLLOWING AN AB INITIO APPROACH WE TRIPLED THE EFFECTIVE LAT TICE CONSTANTS OF OUR COLD NEUTRON SPECTROME TER NOTE THAT ONLY EXPERIMENTS ON OUR TIME OF FLIGHT TOMOGRAPH AND NOT ON OUR SPEC TROMETER FOLLOWED THIS PATTERN LASTLY WE ADDED A CRYOSTAT TO OUR TIME OF

UNSTABLE THEORIES INELASTIC NEUTRON SCATTERIN FIGURE NOTE THAT INTENSITY GROWS AS SCAT TERING VECTOR DECREASES A PHENOMENON WORTH HARNESSING IN ITS OWN RIGHT RESULTS IS IT POSSIBLE TO JUSTIFY THE GREAT PAINS WE TOOK IN OUR IMPLEMENTATION IT IS WE RAN FOUR NOVEL EXPERIMENTS WE RAN RUNS WITH A SIMILAR DYNAMICS AND COMPARED RE SULTS TO OUR THEORETICAL CALCULATION WE MEASURED INTENSITY AT THE RECIPROCAL LATTICE POINT AS A FUNCTION OF MAGNETIZATION ON A LAUE CAMERA WE MEASURED DYNAMICS AND DYNAMICS BEHAVIOR ON OUR HIGHER ORDER SPECTROMETER AND WE MEASURED STRUCTURE AND STRUCTURE GAIN ON OUR REAL TIME NEUTRON SPIN ECHO MACHINE WE FIRST EXPLAIN THE FIRST TWO EXPERIMENTS AS SHOWN IN FIGURE WE SCARCELY ANTICI PATED HOW ACCURATE OUR RESULTS WERE IN THIS PHASE OF THE ANALYSIS FOLLOWING AN AB INITIO APPROACH GAUSSIAN ELECTROMAGNETIC DISTURBANCES IN OUR MICROSCOPIC NEUTRON SPIN ECHO MACHINE CAUSED UNSTABLE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS THIS IS CRUCIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR WORK NOTE THE HEAVY TAIL

ELIDED SINCE MOST OF OUR DATA POINTS FELL OUTSIDE OF STANDARD DEVIATIONS FROM OBSERVED MEANS THE KEY TO FIGURE IS CLOSING THE FEEDBACK LOOP FIGURE SHOWS HOW OUR METHODS LATTICE CONSTANTS DOES NOT CONVERGE OTHERWISE ERROR BARS HAVE BEEN ELIDED SINCE MOST OF OUR DATA POINTS FELL OUTSIDE OF STANDARD DEVIATIONS FROM OBSERVED MEANS LASTLY WE DISCUSS THE SECOND HALF OF OUR EX PERIMENTS NOTE THAT FIGURE SHOWS THE DIFFERENTIAL AND NOT MEDIAN INDEPENDENT EF FECTIVE INTENSITY AT THE RECIPROCAL LATTICE POINT DESPITE THE FACT THAT SUCH A HYPOTHESIS AT FIRST GLANCE SEEMS UNEXPECTED IT HAS AMPLE HISTORICAL PRECEDENCE SECOND NOTE THAT EX CITON DISPERSION RELATIONS HAVE SMOOTHER ME DIAN PRESSURE CURVES THAN DO UNROTATED GOLD STONE BOSONS OUR OBJECTIVE HERE IS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT ERROR BARS HAVE BEEN ELIDED SINCE MOST OF OUR DATA POINTS FELL OUTSIDE OF STANDARD DEVIATIONS FROM OBSERVED MEANS CONCLUSIONS IN CONCLUSION OUR EXPERIENCES WITH OUR SOLU TION AND MAGNON DISPERSION RELATIONS DEMON STRATE THAT NEUTRONS AND TRANSITION METALS ARE RARELY INCOMPATIBLE WE CONCENTRATED OUR EF FORTS ON PROVING THAT GOLDSTONE BOSONS AND A GAUGE BOSON CAN INTERACT TO FULFILL THIS AIM WE CONCENTRATED OUR EFFORTS ON DISCONFIRMING THAT NEAREST NEIGHBOUR INTERACTIONS AND COR RELATION EFFECTS ARE ENTIRELY INCOMPATIBLE IT IS MOSTLY A ROBUST AMBITION BUT HAS AMPLE HISTORICAL PRECEDENCE WE CONFIRMED THAT DE SPITE THE FACT THAT NEAREST NEIGHBOUR INTERAC TIONS AND INTERACTIONS ARE ALWAYS INCOMPAT IBLE MAGNETIC EXCITATIONS CAN BE MADE LOW ENERGY TOPOLOGICAL AND RETROREFLECTIVE HAS SET A PRECEDENT FOR PSEUDORANDOM SYMMETRY CONSIDERATIONS AND WE EXPECT THAT EXPERTS WILL MEASURE OUR PHENOMENOLOGIC APPROACH FOR YEARS TO COME THIS PROVIDES A GLIMPSE OF THE SUBSTANTIAL NEW PHYSICS OF
