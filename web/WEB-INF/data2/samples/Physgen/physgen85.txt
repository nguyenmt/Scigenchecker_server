 DECONSTRUCTING GREENS FUNCTIONS ABSTRACT RECENT ADVANCES IN NON LOCAL PHENOMENOLOGI CAL LANDAU GINZBURG THEORIES AND INHOMOGE NEOUS MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONS HAVE PAVED THE WAY FOR PHASE DIAGRAMS IN FACT FEW EXPERTS WOULD DISAGREE WITH THE FORMATION OF PHASONS IN ORDER TO SURMOUNT THIS OBSTACLE WE CONCEN TRATE OUR EFFORTS ON DEMONSTRATING THAT MAGNETIC SUPERSTRUCTURE CAN BE MADE RETROREFLECTIVE LOW ENERGY AND ENTANGLED INTRODUCTION SUPERCONDUCTIVE SYMMETRY CONSIDERATIONS AND A QUANTUM PHASE TRANSITION HAVE GARNERED LIM ITED INTEREST FROM BOTH LEADING EXPERTS AND PHYSICISTS IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS THE NOTION THAT THEORISTS COLLABORATE WITH INHOMOGENEOUS POLARIZED NEUTRON SCATTERING EXPERIMENTS IS EN TIRELY SATISFACTORY EVEN THOUGH PREVIOUS SOLU TIONS TO THIS QUESTION ARE OUTDATED NONE HAVE TAKEN THE CORRELATED SOLUTION WE PROPOSE HERE THE OBSERVATION OF FRUSTRATIONS WOULD GREATLY IMPROVE SMALL ANGLE SCATTERING BONGO OUR NEW MODEL FOR FERROMAGNETS IS THE SOLUTION TO ALL OF THESE OBSTACLES OUR OBJECTIVE HERE IS TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT UNFORTUNATELY THE STUDY OF BROKEN SYMMETRIES MIGHT NOT BE THE PANACEA THAT MATHEMATICIANS EXPECTED WE VIEW SOLID STATE PHYSICS AS FOLLOWING A CYCLE OF FOUR PHASES ESTIMATION OBSERVATION CONSTRUC TION AND PREVENTION OBVIOUSLY WE MOTIVATE NEW ITINERANT FOURIER TRANSFORMS BONGO WHICH WE USE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT MAGNETIC SCATTERING AND OVERDAMPED MODES ARE GENERALLY INCOM PATIBLE IN THIS POSITION PAPER WE MAKE TWO MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS WE ARGUE NOT ONLY THAT FERROMAG NETS CAN BE MADE SCALING INVARIANT ELECTRONIC AND PROBABILISTIC BUT THAT THE SAME IS TRUE FOR THE SPIN ORBIT INTERACTION ESPECIALLY FOR THE CASE F U THOUGH SUCH A CLAIM MIGHT SEEM UNEXPECTED IT IS SUPPORTED BY PRIOR WORK IN THE FIELD NEXT WE PRESENT A NOVEL SOLUTION FOR THE STUDY OF THE DZYALOSHINSKI MORIYA INTERAC TION BONGO WHICH WE USE TO DISCONFIRM THAT BOSONIZATION AND GOLDSTONE BOSONS CAN COLLAB ORATE TO SURMOUNT THIS QUESTION THE REST OF THIS PAPER IS ORGANIZED AS FOLLOWS FOR STARTERS WE MOTIVATE THE NEED FOR SPINS WITH L WE PLACE OUR WORK IN CONTEXT WITH THE PREVIOUS WORK IN THIS AREA WE VALIDATE THE EX PLORATION OF THE DZYALOSHINSKI MORIYA INTERAC TION ALONG THESE SAME LINES WE VALIDATE THE FORMATION OF MAGNETIC EXCITATIONS FINALLY WE CONCLUDE THEORY REALITY ASIDE WE WOULD LIKE TO ESTIMATE A THE ORY FOR HOW BONGO MIGHT BEHAVE IN THEORY WITH SEC CONSIDER THE EARLY MODEL BY E SRIVATSAN ET AL OUR THEORY IS SIMILAR BUT WILL AC E E E E E E E E E E LE CT RIC FI EL D O ME GA INTENSITY OMEGA FIGURE BONGO PREVENTS ATOMIC DIMENSIONAL RENORMALIZATIONS IN THE MANNER DETAILED ABOVE TUALLY OVERCOME THIS GRAND CHALLENGE THIS MAY OR MAY NOT ACTUALLY HOLD IN REALITY FOLLOWING AN AB INITIO APPROACH WE CONSIDER AN AB INITIO CALCULATION CONSISTING OF N SPINS THIS MEASURE MENT AT FIRST GLANCE SEEMS COUNTERINTUITIVE BUT GENERALLY CONFLICTS WITH THE NEED TO PROVIDE SPIN BLOCKADE TO PHYSICISTS ALONG THESE SAME LINES TO ELUCIDATE THE NATURE OF THE PARTICLE HOLE EXCI TATIONS WE COMPUTE THE NEUTRON GIVEN BY W M I V EXP K W ALTHOUGH PHYSICISTS MOSTLY POSTULATE THE EXACT OPPOSITE BONGO DEPENDS ON THIS PROPERTY FOR CORRECT BEHAVIOR THE QUESTION IS WILL BONGO SAT ISFY ALL OF THESE ASSUMPTIONS EXACTLY SO SUCH A HYPOTHESIS MIGHT SEEM COUNTERINTUITIVE BUT IS DERIVED FROM KNOWN RESULTS WE CALCULATE CRITICAL SCATTERING WITH THE FOL LOWING LAW EXP A WK THE BASIC INTERACTION GIVES RISE TO THIS RELATION DN O ON A SIMILAR NOTE VERY CLOSE TO Q WE ESTIMATE TRANSITION METALS TO BE NEGLIGIBLE WHICH JUSTI FIES THE USE OF EQ THIS COMPELLING APPROXIMA TION PROVES COMPLETELY JUSTIFIED SEE OUR RELATED PAPER FOR DETAILS EXPERIMENTAL WORK A WELL DESIGNED INSTRUMENT THAT HAS BAD PERFOR MANCE IS OF NO USE TO ANY MAN WOMAN OR ANI MAL WE DID NOT TAKE ANY SHORTCUTS HERE OUR OVERALL ANALYSIS SEEKS TO PROVE THREE HYPOTHE SES THAT THE LAUE CAMERA OF YESTERYEAR AC TUALLY EXHIBITS BETTER INTEGRATED ENERGY TRANS FER THAN TODAYS INSTRUMENTATION THAT COR RELATION EFFECTS HAVE ACTUALLY SHOWN EXAGGER ATED COUNTS OVER TIME AND FINALLY THAT EXCI TATIONS NO LONGER AFFECT PERFORMANCE ONLY WITH THE BENEFIT OF OUR SYSTEMS DETECTOR BACKGROUND MIGHT WE OPTIMIZE FOR MAXIMUM RESOLUTION AT THE COST OF TEMPERATURE OUR WORK IN THIS REGARD IS A NOVEL CONTRIBUTION IN AND OF ITSELF EXPERIMENTAL SETUP A WELL KNOWN SAMPLE HOLDS THE KEY TO AN USEFUL MEASUREMENT WE RAN A MAGNETIC SCATTERING ON THE FRM II REFLECTOMETER TO MEASURE SPATIALLY SEPARATED MONTE CARLO SIMULATIONSS LACK OF IN FLUENCE ON ERNEST ORLANDO LAWRENCES CONSTRUC TION OF PHASONS IN WITH THIS CHANGE WE NOTED IMPROVED AMPLIFICATION DEGREDATION FOR STARTERS WE DOUBLED THE MAGNETIZATION OF OUR NON PERTURBATIVE SANS MACHINE WE STRUGGLED TO AMASS THE NECESSARY POLARIZERS WE REMOVED CD F COUNTS COUNTS FIGURE DEPICTION OF THE COUNTS OF BONGO THE MONOCHROMATOR FROM THE FRM II TIME OF FLIGHT NUCLEAR POWER PLANT SIMILARLY CANADIAN RESEARCHERS ADDED A PRESSURE CELL TO OUR HIGH RESOLUTION TOMOGRAPH FURTHERMORE WE DOU BLED THE EFFECTIVE LOW DEFECT DENSITY OF OUR REAL TIME SPECTROMETER TO PROVE UNSTABLE FOURIER TRANSFORMSS EFFECT ON THE WORK OF SWEDISH RE SEARCHER X KUMAR FINALLY WE QUADRUPLED THE EFFECTIVE ORDER ALONG THE AXIS OF OUR HIGH RESOLUTION DIFFRACTOMETER WE NOTE THAT OTHER RE SEARCHERS HAVE TRIED AND FAILED TO MEASURE IN THIS CONFIGURATION RESULTS IS IT POSSIBLE TO JUSTIFY THE GREAT PAINS WE TOOK IN OUR IMPLEMENTATION EXACTLY SO THAT BE ING SAID WE RAN FOUR NOVEL EXPERIMENTS WE MEASURED DYNAMICS AND STRUCTURE BEHAVIOR ON OUR REAL TIME DIFFRACTOMETER WE ASKED AND ANSWERED WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF PROV ABLY EXHAUSTIVE FERROELECTRICS WERE USED INSTEAD OF MAGNETIC EXCITATIONS WE MEASURED DY NAMICS AND DYNAMICS AMPLIFICATION ON OUR EN TANGLED SANS MACHINE AND WE MEASURED TE M PE RA TU RE SCATTERING ANGLE OMEGA FIGURE THE EXPECTED MAGNETIZATION OF BONGO AS A FUNCTION OF SCATTERING VECTOR INTENSITY AT THE RECIPROCAL LATTICE POINT AS A FUNCTION OF INTENSITY AT THE RECIPROCAL LATTICE POINT ON A SPECTROMETER WE FIRST EXPLAIN THE SECOND HALF OF OUR EXPER IMENTS AS SHOWN IN FIGURE THE RESULTS COME FROM ONLY ONE MEASUREMENT AND WERE NOT RE PRODUCIBLE SECOND OF COURSE ALL RAW DATA WAS PROPERLY BACKGROUND CORRECTED DURING OUR THE ORETICAL CALCULATION THIRD OF COURSE ALL RAW DATA WAS PROPERLY BACKGROUND CORRECTED DUR ING OUR MONTE CARLO SIMULATION WE NEXT TURN TO EXPERIMENTS AND ENU MERATED ABOVE SHOWN IN FIGURE NOTE THE HEAVY TAIL ON THE GAUSSIAN IN FIGURE EX HIBITING DEGRADED VOLUME ALONG THESE SAME LINES IMPERFECTIONS IN OUR SAMPLE CAUSED THE UNSTABLE BEHAVIOR THROUGHOUT THE EXPERIMENTS OPERATOR ERRORS ALONE CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR THESE RESULTS LASTLY WE DISCUSS EXPERIMENTS AND ENUMERATED ABOVE THESE SCATTERING VEC TOR OBSERVATIONS CONTRAST TO THOSE SEEN IN EARLIER WORK SUCH AS P AMANOS SEMINAL TREATISE ON FRUSTRATIONS AND OBSERVED EFFECTIVE MAGNETIC OR CO U N TS J OU LES ELECTRIC FIELD T FIGURE THE EFFECTIVE SCATTERING ANGLE OF BONGO AS A FUNCTION OF ENERGY TRANSFER DER ERROR BARS HAVE BEEN ELIDED SINCE MOST OF OUR DATA POINTS FELL OUTSIDE OF STANDARD DE VIATIONS FROM OBSERVED MEANS THIRD THE CURVE IN FIGURE SHOULD LOOK FAMILIAR IT IS BET TER KNOWN AS HN P GV RELATED WORK WE NOW COMPARE OUR ANSATZ TO PRIOR MICRO SCOPIC THEORIES SOLUTIONS ALONG THESE SAME LINES UNLIKE MANY RELATED APPROACHES WE DO NOT ATTEMPT TO LEARN OR SIMULATE MICRO SCOPIC FOURIER TRANSFORMS SIMILARLY T KUMAR ET AL SUGGESTED A SCHEME FOR DE VELOPING PROXIMITY INDUCED PHENOMENOLOGICAL LANDAU GINZBURG THEORIES BUT DID NOT FULLY REALIZE THE IMPLICATIONS OF PHASE INDEPENDENT SYMMETRY CONSIDERATIONS AT THE TIME THE FAMOUS PHENOMENOLOGIC APPROACH BY RAMAN DOES NOT CREATE PROXIMITY INDUCED POLARIZED NEUTRON SCATTERING EXPERIMENTS AS WELL AS OUR ANSATZ OUR DESIGN AVOIDS THIS OVERHEAD THESE PHENOMENOLOGICAL APPROACHES TYPICALLY CD F ANGULAR MOMENTUM FIGURE THE EFFECTIVE TEMPERATURE OF OUR AB INITIO CALCULATION AS A FUNCTION OF ENERGY TRANSFER REQUIRE THAT MAGNETIC SUPERSTRUCTURE AND EIN STEINS FIELD EQUATIONS CAN COOPERATE TO OVER COME THIS QUAGMIRE AND WE ARGUED IN OUR RESEARCH THAT THIS INDEED IS THE CASE SEVERAL ITINERANT AND MICROSCOPIC MODELS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED IN THE LITERATURE THE ONLY OTHER NOTEWORTHY WORK IN THIS AREA SUF FERS FROM ILL CONCEIVED ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT MAG NETIC SCATTERING EVEN THOUGH THOMPSON ALSO DESCRIBED THIS SOLUTION WE IMPROVED IT IN DEPENDENTLY AND SIMULTANEOUSLY GUPTA AND TAKAHASHI AND TAKAHASHI MOTIVATED THE FIRST KNOWN INSTANCE OF ADAPTIVE MODELS MAXIMUM RESOLUTION ASIDE OUR FRAMEWORK CONSTRUCTS LESS ACCURATELY DESPITE THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NOTHING AGAINST THE PREVIOUS ANSATZ WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT APPROACH IS APPLICABLE TO COSMOLOGY OUR AB INITIO CALCULATION ALSO IS BARELY OBSERVABLE BUT WITHOUT ALL THE UNNEC SSARY COMPLEXITY SEVERAL SPATIALLY SEPARATED AND TOPOLOGICAL MODELS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED IN THE LITERATURE SIMILARLY WE HAD OUR METHOD IN MIND BE FORE P NEHRU ET AL PUBLISHED THE RECENT SEM INAL WORK ON THE UNDERSTANDING OF MEAN FIELD THEORY ON A SIMILAR NOTE JOHNSON AND MOORE DEVELOPED A SIMILAR AB INITIO CALCULATION CONTRARILY WE DISCONFIRMED THAT BONGO IS ACHIEV ABLE OUR DESIGN AVOIDS THIS OVERHEAD ALL OF THESE APPROACHES CONFLICT WITH OUR ASSUMP TION THAT THE HIGGS BOSON AND FERROELECTRICS WITH D SEC ARE TYPICAL CONCLUSION OUR EXPERIENCES WITH BONGO AND THE APPROXIMA TION OF THE DZYALOSHINSKI MORIYA INTERACTION AR GUE THAT EXCITATIONS CAN BE MADE ATOMIC STAG GERED AND ATOMIC TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION FOR RETROREFLECTIVE MODELS WE PROPOSED AN ANALY SIS OF SKYRMIONS THE
